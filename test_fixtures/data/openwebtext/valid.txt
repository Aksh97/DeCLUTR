Labour and the Greens say they're committed to running budget surpluses, paying debt and keeping spending down. The two parties will present their 'Budget Responsibility Rules' to business leaders, economists, NGOs and academics on Friday morning. "People want to know the kinds of principles that we're going to manage the books by," Labour leader Andrew Little told The AM Show. The two parties' economic policies have differed in the past, and while they'll still have separate policies, the rules are a "framework" for working together in government, said Labour finance spokesman Grant Robertson. Among the rules are: running surpluses (barring major economic shocks or natural disasters) keep Crown spending to about 30 percent of GDP a progressive, fairer tax system reduce net debt to 20 percent of GDP in five years increase investment in superannuation, climate change and infrastructure. "We're committed to running surpluses over an economic cycle," says Mr Little. "We're going to be responsible with the government budget. There's stuff we've already committed to - we've got to fix housing, we've got to fix health, we've got to fix education." Crown spending currently is at 30 percent of GDP, according to Treasury figures. The 2016 Budget predicted it would drop to about 28 percent by 2020, under National.
DOWNEY, Calif. When Mario Guerra strolls through the streets of downtown Downey, he cant help but play the role of seasoned salesman for the city in southeastern Los Angeles County he adopted more than 35 years ago. Guerra, a Cuban-American immigrant who served eight years on the city council and two terms as mayor, sings the praises of Portos Bakery, a Cuban sandwich and pastry shop that he helped lure to Downey. He shows off the vibrant murals and sleekly designed street sculpture that he commissioned as a city leader to spruce up the downtown area and imbue it with a sense of culture and character. Subsequently, an acquaintance stops Guerra, known about town for his role as a Catholic deacon as well as consummate problem-solver, to ask if Guerra would perform his wedding at the towns annual Dia de los Muertes festival. Guerra, a Republican in a city that is 70 percent Hispanic and leans Democratic, attributes his success as a GOP politician to a laser-like focus on finding solutions, building bridges and approaching every problem with a kind of neighborly compassion. Its how Guerra says he came within 5 percentage points of his opponent in his race for a state Senate seat last fall in a district where Democrats have a 24-point voter registration advantage I govern in that 60 to 70 percent where I feel that we can all agree and say, Lets just make things better, he said.
Let's just get something out of the way: the Phillies are not a good baseball team. Ryan Howard is listed as the number one starter at first base on the depth chart, and it's not 2009. Freddy Galvis and Cesar Hernandez compose the middle infield; Cedric Hunter and Peter Bourjos are the starting corner outfielders. Those are five players that shouldn't be starters, starting, but this is the reality that the Phillies currently inhabit. Fortunately for Philadelphia, and their fans, they have already have the pieces in place to help them make a quantum leap. Through a series of trades, and good drafts, the Phillies are in a position to put a competitive baseball team on the field as early as 2017. Homegrown players Philadelphia has two players that have come through their own farm system and that could be ready as soon as this year: J.P. Crawford and Andrew Knapp. 2015 PA BB% K% ISO wOBA wRC+ Crawford (AA) 405 12.1% 11.1% .142 .348 121 Andrew Knapp (AA) 241 9.1% 17.8% .271 .465 200 Both players spent the majority of their 2015 seasons in AA, and they were fantastic. Knapp, a catcher, showcased more power and a better offensive line overall, but in no way should that diminish Crawford's campaign. FanGraphs rates his future value at 60 (out of 80), and he's expected to be the next shortstop prospect to join the surfeit of budding MLB stars at that position.
Is it possible to completely eliminate scent? Share this article Every day a new scent control product seems to hit the market. How do you make sense of the marketing tidal wave that hits you every time you turn on the T.V. or open a hunting magazine? Do scent control products actually work? Is it possible to completely eliminate odor? Maybe. In this article, I will uncover the answers to those questions and determine the best way to remain undetected in the field. How animals smell Animals have special membranes in their noses that pick up scent signatures in the air. In fact, deer and elk have more receptors in their noses than even dogs. Deer and elk can also use an additional organ in their mouth, called a vomeronasal organ, to detect smells. This allows them to detect multiple scents simultaneously and makes it possible for them to detect smells that are incredibly far away. This means that the proverbial deck is stacked against a hunter almost immediately because animals can smell you before you ever see them. Types of scent It will be easiest to understand scent control if we first understand scent in general. There are three types of scents that comprise the smells that an animal will pick up: natural, unnatural/foreign and odor. Natural Natural smells are those smells that naturally occur in its given environment.
