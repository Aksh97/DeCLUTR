Just two months into the baseball season, the Cubs are exceeding fans' expectations and creating a national buzz with one of the best records in the National League. But, quietly, progress also is being made off the field as team Chairman Tom Ricketts methodically moves to gain further control of the neighborhood streets just beyond the walls of Wrigley Field and win his battle with the rooftop businesses that help define the Wrigley vibe. His latest coup came earlier this month, records show, when an entity controlled by the Ricketts family bought three more rooftop buildings on Sheffield Avenue, bringing to six the number the family now owns.
Im surrounded by big spenders at family gatherings. My siblings, their spouses/partners, my uncles and cousins all seem to spend at least every dime they make. The thing is, these arent poor people struggling to get by. The poorest among them brings in probably around $65k/year, and the others are well into the six figures. So they all have two or three refrigerators. One for the kitchen, one for freezing meats and vegetables in the basement and one in the garage just full of beer and soda. They all have cars no more than 2 years old.
Colorado cannabis is better than anything Amsterdam's got, and the medicine here is on par with, if not better than, what is coming out of California. While we already knew that here in Colorado, it was still cool to hear those words come out of High Times editor Danny Danko's mouth last night at the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup award ceremony. I don't think anyone really knew what to expect from the Cannabis Cup. Even dispensary owners I spoke with beforehand had only an inkling. Were people really going to be able to light up? Would staffers be able to hand out meds to patients?
Diesel engines are starting to make a return in the United States but they have been massively popular for decades in Europe. Its not just economy cars, either: AMG has built a diesel engine, oil-burning Audis have won the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans on several occasions and BMW offers a 5-Series with a triple-turbocharged 3.0-liter straight-six diesel worthy of a M badge on the trunk lid. 40 years ago, Peugeot and Mercedes-Benz were among the very few manufacturers that offered a diesel in a passenger car and the thought of a compression ignition engine mounted in the engine bay of a sports car was a daring one that only Mercedes was willing to dabble in with the C111-III, a 230-horsepower experimental sports car that was never given the green light for production.
New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker came under attack after his Wednesday night vote against allowing the importation of cheaper drugs from Canada into the United States. The amendment to the budget resolution bill would have encouraged the importing of cheaper pharmaceutical products into the U.S. to lower prescription drug prices. Those exorbitant price tags, which are set by pharmaceutical companies, are putting a financial crunch on families, according to a Consumer Reports survey. Spending on drugs is also taking a huge bite out of not only families' pocketbooks, but also government coffers which could end up coming back to bite taxpayers again.
