Labour and the Greens say they're committed to running budget surpluses, paying debt and keeping spending down. The two parties will present their 'Budget Responsibility Rules' to business leaders, economists, NGOs and academics on Friday morning. "People want to know the kinds of principles that we're going to manage the books by," Labour leader Andrew Little told The AM Show. The two parties' economic policies have differed in the past, and while they'll still have separate policies, the rules are a "framework" for working together in government, said Labour finance spokesman Grant Robertson. Among the rules are: running surpluses (barring major economic shocks or natural disasters) keep Crown spending to about 30 percent of GDP a progressive, fairer tax system reduce net debt to 20 percent of GDP in five years increase investment in superannuation, climate change and infrastructure. "We're committed to running surpluses over an economic cycle," says Mr Little. "We're going to be responsible with the government budget. There's stuff we've already committed to - we've got to fix housing, we've got to fix health, we've got to fix education." Crown spending currently is at 30 percent of GDP, according to Treasury figures. The 2016 Budget predicted it would drop to about 28 percent by 2020, under National. It peaked in 2011, in the wake of the global financial crisis, at around 34 percent. The last time Labour was in government, Finance Minister Michael Cullen ran up a series of significant surpluses, but came under fire for not cutting taxes. No tax increases are planned if Labour does win the upcoming election. "Every commitment we've made we can fund out of existing tax revenue," said Mr Little. The Greens went into the last election promising a new top tax rate of 40 percent on income over $140,000. Co-leader James Shaw wouldn't say if that would be the case this year, saying the party's focus wouldn't be on income tax. "A lot of people don't know this, but at the last election we actually promised a tax cut for 97 percent of New Zealanders," he told The AM Show. "That was going to be funded out of a tax on pollution that causes climate change." A capital gains tax would likely be included in the Greens' economic policy, but not Labour's. "It won't be exactly the same as what we've said in the past," said Mr Shaw. Coalition negotiations As for who'll take what job should the left bloc win the election, Mr Shaw says it's wide open. "The largest party in government is guaranteed the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. Everything else depends on what happens on election night." Mr Little isn't ruling out overlooking deputy Jacinda Ardern for the Deputy Prime Minister role, should the Greens' share of the vote demand it. "We've got a good close relationship, but one thing we're very clear about - we're not allocating jobs, responsibilities, portfolios or anything before the numbers come in." A new Newshub poll on Friday has found Mr Little has the support of Labour voters, but Ms Ardern isn't far behind. She pipped him in the preferred Prime Minister stakes however, when asking voters of all political persuasions. Newshub.
DOWNEY, Calif. When Mario Guerra strolls through the streets of downtown Downey, he cant help but play the role of seasoned salesman for the city in southeastern Los Angeles County he adopted more than 35 years ago. Guerra, a Cuban-American immigrant who served eight years on the city council and two terms as mayor, sings the praises of Portos Bakery, a Cuban sandwich and pastry shop that he helped lure to Downey. He shows off the vibrant murals and sleekly designed street sculpture that he commissioned as a city leader to spruce up the downtown area and imbue it with a sense of culture and character. Subsequently, an acquaintance stops Guerra, known about town for his role as a Catholic deacon as well as consummate problem-solver, to ask if Guerra would perform his wedding at the towns annual Dia de los Muertes festival. Guerra, a Republican in a city that is 70 percent Hispanic and leans Democratic, attributes his success as a GOP politician to a laser-like focus on finding solutions, building bridges and approaching every problem with a kind of neighborly compassion. Its how Guerra says he came within 5 percentage points of his opponent in his race for a state Senate seat last fall in a district where Democrats have a 24-point voter registration advantage I govern in that 60 to 70 percent where I feel that we can all agree and say, Lets just make things better, he said. Were not going to agree on everything but we can agree on this stuff that we can fix, and its in that space that you can get things done. But to Guerras dismay, its a markedly different philosophy than the one that seems to have taken hold within the Republican Party at the national level in the 2016 presidential cycle, particularly with the rise of Donald Trump. Guerra has watched with a mixture of bewilderment and exasperation as the business mogul has ridden to the top of the polls in part by spewing barbed invective against illegal immigration, and branding Latino immigrants as criminals and rapists. In preparation of going on Spanish-language television to talk about the summer of Trump, Guerra brushed up to make sure he had one specific word in his arsenal payaso clown. For Californians, the narrative playing out at the national level has an air of dj vu. Twenty years ago, a similar wave of anti-immigrant sentiment washed over the Golden State, and voters responded by passing a ballot initiative that blocked undocumented immigrants from receiving a litany of critical state services, including public education and health care. Strongly championing Proposition 187 helped then-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson win re-election in 1994 but the victory for the California GOP turned out to be short-lived. Political analysts believe the referendum mobilized dormant Latino voters and helped transform the state into a Democratic stronghold. No GOP presidential candidate has won the state since George H.W. Bush in 1988, while Democrats have had a lock on most statewide offices and the state legislature since 1996. It was a frustration with the finances of the state at the time and who was getting what benefits, and the Republican Party was painted by this broad stroke that were anti-immigrant because of Prop 187. Its not true, but thats the way we were painted, Guerra said. The impact of that characterization has been long-lasting, Guerra noted, with officials like him continuing to fight a particular stigma among some Latino-Americans because of their party identification. If there were no D's or R's on the ballots next to our names, Id be a state senator today, Guerra said. As the GOP candidates prepare to descend on Southern California this week for the second Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, some warn that the national Republican Party is destined to suffer the same fate if it continues to elevate Trumps immigration positions and alienate large swaths of the nations growing share of Latino voters. Among other things, Trump has proposed mass deportations and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. What happened in California then is whats happening nationally today, said Arturo Carmona, executive director of Presente.org, a California-based Latino civic advocacy organization. In 1994, Pete Wilson dared to go after services for pregnant mothers, he went after educational services, in a way that no other governor had done in recent history and it energized the Latino electorate in a way that we had not seen. It changed the face of Californias electoral map for decades. Now, this field or Republican candidates have all but declared war on immigrants and Latinos, Carmona added. Thats not something that we can let go of. In Downey, it seems the association between the Republican Party and anti-immigrant stances and rhetoric has already taken root. Its embarrassing, to be honest, for Trump, and its a cruel stance, said Gabe Enamorado, a 26-year-old Guatemalan-American and creative director for a local art gallery. All youre doing is riling up this army of young Latinos to vote against you. They are going to stand up to what they believe in, so in a weird way I see it as a good thing. Luis Castrellon, 35, a businessman from neighboring Rialto, Calif. who works in health care, said he lays the blame not only on Trump but at the feet of the wider GOP field for mimicking his talking points. Indeed, even as some GOP candidates most notably former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush have beat back against his characterizations of illegal immigrants, others have been more reluctant to attack Trump. Its very infuriating that its so accepted for Trump to be able to say those things and still be a leader in the Republican Party, Castrellon said, noting that in the past hes voted for both Republicans and Democrats. I feel offended for my community. Still, in the midst of a heated national battle over what to do about the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants and indeed, how to best integrate immigrants into the fabric of U.S. society, the city of Downey is instructive in other ways. A majority-white suburb whose economy was powered by aerospace engineering in the 1980s, Downey is now known as a thriving community made up of first and second-generation immigrants who have climbed into the middle class. Nick Velez, 28, a Mexican-American veteran who opened a downtown bar after returning home from serving in the Marine Corps in 2012, said Latino success is one of the towns unique characteristics and may show the path forward for the rest of the country. Everywhere you turn there are brown faces, and they are successful brown faces, he said. Its a city that says I started from nothing and Im here now and Im on my way up.
Let's just get something out of the way: the Phillies are not a good baseball team. Ryan Howard is listed as the number one starter at first base on the depth chart, and it's not 2009. Freddy Galvis and Cesar Hernandez compose the middle infield; Cedric Hunter and Peter Bourjos are the starting corner outfielders. Those are five players that shouldn't be starters, starting, but this is the reality that the Phillies currently inhabit. Fortunately for Philadelphia, and their fans, they have already have the pieces in place to help them make a quantum leap. Through a series of trades, and good drafts, the Phillies are in a position to put a competitive baseball team on the field as early as 2017. Homegrown players Philadelphia has two players that have come through their own farm system and that could be ready as soon as this year: J.P. Crawford and Andrew Knapp. 2015 PA BB% K% ISO wOBA wRC+ Crawford (AA) 405 12.1% 11.1% .142 .348 121 Andrew Knapp (AA) 241 9.1% 17.8% .271 .465 200 Both players spent the majority of their 2015 seasons in AA, and they were fantastic. Knapp, a catcher, showcased more power and a better offensive line overall, but in no way should that diminish Crawford's campaign. FanGraphs rates his future value at 60 (out of 80), and he's expected to be the next shortstop prospect to join the surfeit of budding MLB stars at that position. He's starting the year at AA, but with a current wOBA of .421 and a wRC+ of 164 though 43 at-bats, he's likely going to join Knapp at AAA relatively soon. The Phillies don't want to start anyone's service clock sooner than they have to, but Knapp seems like a safe bet to see time at the major league level this year. Carlos Ruiz (likely) won't be playing for Philadelphia beyond this year, and Cameron Rupp (with his career wOBA of .282 and wRC+ of 75) isn't going to block Knapp from reaching the big leagues. The catcher's spot is up for grabs on the big league club, and Knapp has a chance to entrench himself as the starter. There's also Aaron Nola, who's already at the big league level. In the first 91.2 innings of his career, Nola's posted a K/9 of 8.35 and a BB/9 of 1.87, along with an ERA of 3.53, an FIP of 3.81, and an fWAR of 1.3. In two starts this year, he's striking out a significantly higher percentage of batters than he did in 2015, and has yet to walk anybody. He's under team control through the 2021 season, and barring an injury, Nola should be one of the Phillies' front line starters for years to come. Philadelphia also has Aaron Altherr (currently on the DL) and Roman Quinn moving up through their system. Altherr was expected to be a starting outfielder for the Phillies in 2016, but he tore a ligament in his left wrist during spring training. In 161 plate appearances at the major league level in 2015, Altherr posted a wOBA of .353 and a wRC+ of 124. He wasn't a highly touted prospect during his time in the minors, but he posted above average results in 2014 at High-A, as well as AA and AAA in 2015. Quinn has yet to progress beyond AA, but he's not far away from his next promotion. In 2015, he posted a wOBA of .361 and a wRC+ of 129 in 257 PA's. Quinn is off to a slow start this season, but it's far too early to worry about him. According to FanGraphs, he has 80-grade speed, which is Billy Hamilton fast, and has a future value of 45. The Trades This is where the Phillies truly accelerated their timeline for contention. Crawford, Knapp, and Nola would have helped Philadelphia take the next step forward, but those three alone couldn't have thrust them back into the race for a playoff spot. Fortunately, Cole Hamels and Ken Giles helped bring back an incredible amount of talent to the Phillies' organization. In the Hamels trade with Texas, Philadelphia was able to acquire Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, Nick Williams, Jerad Eickhoff, Alec Asher and Matt Harrison. Of those six players, Williams ranks 2nd in Baseball America's top 10 for Philadelphia, while Thompson is 3rd, and Alfaro is 5th. Eickhoff would undoubtedly be in that group, but he's already at the big league level, and posting impressive results. In his first 63 innings, Eickhoff has a K/9 of 8.71, a BB/9 of 2.14, and a HR/9 of 0.71, along with an ERA of 2.43, and an FIP of 3.00. He doesn't possess extraordinary velocity, but he has a knee-buckling curveball, and has demonstrated excellent control throughout his professional career. The trade of Hamels alone was enough to significantly advance Philadelphia's timeline for contention, but it was the trade of Ken Giles that pushed them over the top. For reasons that are still unclear (at least to me), Houston sent Vincent Velasquez, Mark Appel, Thomas Eshelman, Brett Oberholtzer, and Harold Arauz to the Phillies in exchange for Giles and infielder Jonathan Arauz. While the emphasis on the bullpen has skyrocketed in the recent past, it seems grossly irresponsible for any team to part with five players in exchange for a 17-year-old (Arauz), and a reliever that won't ever throw more than 90 innings in a single season. Over the last two seasons, Giles has undoubtedly been one of the most valuable relievers in baseball, but there were less expensive ways of fortifying the Astros' bullpen. As a result of the trade, Houston lost three significant starting pitching prospects, one of whom just had what could ultimately prove to be one of the best outings of the 2016 season. As Jeff Sullivan noted, Velasquez has everything working for him. It's not like Velasquez has come out of nowhere or anything, since he was the key to the Ken Giles trade, but he's been something of a wild card. Velasquez arrived with a lot of uncertainly, just another powerful arm with question marks. Then, Thursday, Velasquez delivered one of the better starts the Phillies organization has seen. By the numbers, that's not even exaggerating. He was, granted, pitching against the Padres a Padres lineup without its best hitter but Velasquez was completely untouchable. Something is becoming clear here in the early going: Velasquez has almost everything working for him... Velasquez has a big breaking ball. He has whats almost a 12-to-6 curve, and compared to last year, this 2016 curve is getting more drop. Last season, 1% of Velasquezs pitches dropped at least eight inches according to PITCHf/x. This season, hes at 17%. Hes moved from something of a slurve to more of a true hammer, and he somehow has control over it. In the ninth inning of his start against San Diego, Velasquez was still touching 96 MPH, and finished his complete game shutout with 16 strikeouts. As Jeff noted, he managed to record 20 swings and misses on his fastball alone, which is tied with David Price, Matt Harvey, and Max Scherzer for the most ever in the PITCHf/x era. A straight up trade of Giles for Velasquez likely would have been a mismatch in the Phillies' favor, but they somehow managed to pry Mark Appel and Thomas Eshelman away from the Astros. While Appel's stock has fallen considerably in the three years since he was selected first overall, that doesn't mean his career is over. He no longer profiles as a potential ace, but he's certainly pitched well enough to be seen as a future fourth or fifth starter. As for Eshelman, he hasn't yet made a start above High-A, and has only accrued 22.1 innings thus far in his professional career, but has significant prospect pedigree after being taken 46th overall in the 2015 draft. As Dan Farsnworth noted in March, he had downright fantastic numbers in college: Eshelman's college stats were borderline hilarious, as he struck out just over a batter per inning in his last year at Cal State-Fullerton while walking only seven. Not seven per nine innings mind you, but seven per 137 innings. He isn't just a guy that pounds the zone either, showing truly impressive command of his fastball, even if it lacks the sort of movement that would separate if from the pack. Farnsworth goes on to say that Eshelman's offspeed pitches aren't above-average just yet, but the "command with which he throws it gives everything a bump up a tick or so, grade-wise." Money Committed This is where the Phillies can get creative. With a number of controllable players coming through their system, they'll have a great deal of financial flexibility moving forward. The table below shows exactly how much guaranteed money Philadelphia has committed on a yearly basis. Money committed 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Ryan Howard $25.0M $10.0M NA NA NA Matt Harrision $13.2M $13.2M $2M buyout NA NA Carlos Ruiz $8.5M $500K buyout NA NA NA Charlie Morton $8.0M NA NA NA NA Total $54.7M $23.7M $2M $0 $0 These are the only four players that Philadelphia has committed money to beyond 2016. In 2018, they have just $2 million set aside for a buyout of Matt Harrison's contract, and after that, they're completely free. Obviously the Phillies will be paying their players something in those years, but they don't have any significant contracts to worry about, which is what's held them back for the past several years. They'll have some arbitration-eligible players to take care of, and eventually they'll need to think about extensions, but looking at their commitments now, and it's easy to see that the Phillies have more financial flexibility than almost any team in baseball. Philadelphia's ownership group has also demonstrated a real capacity to spend (if not quite to the levels of the Dodgers and Yankees of the world), meaning no free agent will be out of the Phillies' reach in 2018 and beyond. With a new front office that's placing a greater importance on advanced analytics, and a stocked farm system thanks to both good drafts and good trades, the future is not only bright in Philadelphia, but closer than it may seem. . . .

Is it possible to completely eliminate scent? Share this article Every day a new scent control product seems to hit the market. How do you make sense of the marketing tidal wave that hits you every time you turn on the T.V. or open a hunting magazine? Do scent control products actually work? Is it possible to completely eliminate odor? Maybe. In this article, I will uncover the answers to those questions and determine the best way to remain undetected in the field. How animals smell Animals have special membranes in their noses that pick up scent signatures in the air. In fact, deer and elk have more receptors in their noses than even dogs. Deer and elk can also use an additional organ in their mouth, called a vomeronasal organ, to detect smells. This allows them to detect multiple scents simultaneously and makes it possible for them to detect smells that are incredibly far away. This means that the proverbial deck is stacked against a hunter almost immediately because animals can smell you before you ever see them. Types of scent It will be easiest to understand scent control if we first understand scent in general. There are three types of scents that comprise the smells that an animal will pick up: natural, unnatural/foreign and odor. Natural Natural smells are those smells that naturally occur in its given environment. The smell of pine trees, the smell of a deer's coat, etc.; however, natural smells are not just those smells that are found in nature. Human beings also have a natural smell even though we do not actually smell it. This is because our brains recognize it as our own scent and the way we are programmed, it becomes useless information that does not register for us. But that does not mean that it is not there. I could shower with scentless soap and scentless shampoo and I would still have a natural scent. Natural scents cannot be removed; they can only be masked. Unnatural/foreign Unnatural or foreign smells are those that are not naturally occurring. Scented detergents might be mountain fresh, but in the woods in the fall that smell is unnatural. Coffee is an unnatural smell as well as vehicle exhaust. Unnatural scents can be removed with little effort. Simply by being aware of these unnatural or foreign smells is enough to make changes that can drastically reduce or eliminate them. Odor Odor is a specific type of scent because it is caused by the growth of bacteria in an environment. Sweat does not smell like body odor until it stays in a dark, wet area of your body (i.e., your armpit) for an extended period of time and bacteria begins to grow. The only way to eliminate the smell of odor is to eliminate the bacteria that causes it. In order to be truly scent free in the field, you must address all of the above form of scent and odor. By only addressing one of the three, you will still be exposed. Continued below. Types of scent control There are countless types of scent control products on the market today. It can be incredibly overwhelming. The last time that I was in a hunting store, it seemed like everything related to hunting had some kind of scent reducing or eliminating quality or endorsement. This is why it can be so confusing. To simplify scent control a bit, all of these different products and technologies are essentially doing one of two things. Either it is eliminating a specific type of scent or it is masking, or covering up, scent. Chemically treated soap For body odor and general smells, soaps treated with enzymes help kill bacteria and prevent the build up of additional odor causing bacteria. These soaps are perfume free so you are not removing one scent only to replace it with another. Chemically treated fabric A common form of scent control is the use of certain chemicals in clothing. Nearly every hunting apparel company on the market has a form of this, but it is all based on the same idea: the chemicals in the clothing prevent the buildup of odor due to bacteria not being able to live in the clothing. For example, KUIU uses a fabric from Toray for odor prevention that incorporates the same medical-grade bacteria prevention used in hospitals to prevent MRSA from spreading. First Lite uses Xeolite technology for the same reason. Other companies use silver because silver has anti-bacterial properties. The list goes on. Bacteria cannot live in the clothing, thus odor cannot build up. The issue with chemically treated clothing though is how it responds to scents that are not bacteria-based. The use of carbon is an effective compromise to this issue as carbon absorbs any and all scent, not just odor. Yet, carbon will reach absorption if not washed properly on a regular basis. Natural fabric Some naturally occurring fabrics are effective at controlling odor as well. Bacteria cannot grow on merino wool, which makes merino wool an effective, long-term solution for odor control when a daily bath and clean change of clothes is not an option. Be aware that just like chemically treated fabric, this does not mean that merino wool removes all foreign scent. Ozone Ozone is a naturally occurring compound that cleans our air and water. It is used as a form of scent control and is quickly gaining support. A portable machine that creates Ozone can be hung in a blind or tree stand and a fan pushes it ahead of you. The Ozone effectively disrupts the animal's ability to identify your scent. It works very, very well; however, Ozone units are very expensive, are difficult to use if you are constantly on the move, and if it malfunctions you are busted. Receptor overload/confusion Another form of scent control uses a technique known as receptor overload (or confusion). Essentially, you use a spray that causes an animal's nose to be confused by a myriad of different scents all at once, causing the animal's brain to subconsciously disregard all information it is receiving from its nose. It is an interesting idea. Natural cover-up Ancient Native Americans would use the plants and the smells of nature as a cover for human scent and people still do this today. Picking up soil and leaves and brush from the area you are hunting and putting it in with your hunting clothes can be an effective way of "blending in" when it comes to smells. Also, simmering leaves and soil in water and using it as a cover scent is an old-timer technique that still works. The biggest issue here though is that this in no way addresses odor. The most effective ways to reduce scent So with all of these different forms of scent control, what is the most effective way to address odor and foreign scent? Address all forms of scent accordingly When it comes to controlling your scent, you have to address all forms of smells accordingly. I start by showering with scentless, odor-eliminating soap. I also wash all of my clothes in scentless, odor-killing detergent after which I pack them in an airtight bag until I get out into the field. I carry field wipes and scent-masking spray in the field at all times. I will use cover-scents when naturally occurring; however, improper use of cover scents will spook an animal just like human scent will so I use it sparingly. While it is easy to see how many areas must be addressed for proper odor and scent prevention, there is still the most important form of scent control left to address: wind. Wind Wind is the most important factor when it comes to scent and odor. If you are upwind from an animal, you are going to get busted! Unless you are very lucky or that bull or buck is rut crazed and does not care, you will more than likely still get busted by his nose. If you are downwind from that same animal, then the wind will carry your scent away. Wind is a crucial component to staying undetected in the woods. Relying solely on new technology is foolish. I always try to pretend as though I have no scent-reducing gear on so that I am always aware of the wind. This ensures that I make the most at everything that I have at my disposal to remain undetected. Cleaners, sprays and chemically treated clothing cannot hurt, but they are no substitute for careful, attentive hunting. When it comes to scent and odor, keep your brain on and your attention focused on the conditions. I have rarely heard of someone 20 yards downwind that did not get busted, but I have seen plenty of guys decked out in carbon clothing get busted by a downwind bull. I have also seen guys in jeans and a cotton shirt never be detected by an upwind animal. Do your best to eliminate the scents you have control over, but always play the wind correctly. Our ancestors hunted for thousands of years without a spray bottle full of enzymes; we can do the same. I think that a combination of both old time and new techniques is the best formula for success.

It dominated its neighbors and basked in glory. The Victorians made remarkable technological achievements in steam-powered machinery. Imperial airships flew over the many lands and provinces under its control. The foundation of the Empires power was the celebrium trees growing on the Acribo Islands. Its precious sap fueled its technological wonders, but the empire had a dark secret. Harvesting the sap of the trees drove the workers mad. Day after day, the Acribian laborers slaved away in nightmarish conditions, all for the sake of harvesting the cursed tree. A storm was brewing that could not be seen from above, and one day, everything changed. The ancient gods of the Acribo Islands returned and took revenge on the Victorians exploiting their people. Devastating cataclysms struck the land. Having suffered long under the yoke of the Empire, the Acribians rebelled in a war that nearly drowned the country in blood, and they declared their independence. The world was never the same. Time passed. The crisis was over, but the Empires greatness was gone. So was its industry, and the lives of so many of its citizens. It lost its access to the celebrium trees. But now, Victoria is healing its wounds and it is time to take action. All that remains of its air force is mustering and the Imperial airships are headed West. This is where your story begins. Bring the Empire back to its former glory! You must win whatever it takes. Airships Airships are the pinnacle of technology in Steam Hammer. To make one, you have to accumulate enormous stockpiles of resources and build a special dockyard. Airships themselves are modular, meaning that you can install and remove a variety of turrets, upgrade the fuel tanks or engine (boosting range and speed), etc. Players can use airships as mobile platforms from which to strike enemy strongholds or as formidable weapons in the battle for air supremacy. Dont forget that they can be shot down or even captured! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Jetpacks Players lean heavily on jetpacks to fly short distances. Theyre perfect for leapfrogging fortress walls, flying over to enemy airships, adding power to hammer blows, and quickly altering lines of fire. In other words, they represent a huge combat advantage. In addition to that, however, jetpacks also let you carry more loot. There are two types in the game, each with their own unique attributes. Crafting The game has a varied crafting system that includes both mining and production. Some resources can be gathered on the earths surface (wood, celebrium, copper, medicinal herbs, clay, and more), and others are mined (iron, aluminum, gold, etc.). Sometimes you have to turn over entire mountains before you have enough of a resource. All resources and crafts have a quality ratinguse better-quality ingredients when youre crafting and youll walk away with a better product. All resources can be used to make the items and machines needed to survive in the harsh world of Saol. Theres a ton you can create: from primitive copper shovels to the gigantic factories you need to produce airships. Construction You can also build things in the game: workshops and factories, defenses, homes, and more. Workshops and factories help you craft things, defenses keep your city safe, and you can decorate you houses however you want. All you need to start building is a little crafting and mining to get the materials. Just remember that every once in a while youll have to fight off enemies trying to capture your city. Leveling up, classes Characters have production and combat abilities that can be improved however you want (until you hit the skill cap). Abilities are leveled up by using existing items and finishing certain tasks: for example, your metallurgy skill is improved by looking for, mining, and smelting minerals. You can decide which skills you want to upgrade to which level, in the process making your own unique character. For example, you could have a metalworker/blacksmith with a little alchemist thrown in or mix an engineer/farmer with construction abilities (hi, Cyrus Smith!). The same is true for combat abilities: you can become a deadly archer, go for a brutal hand-to-hand combat expert, or focus on the ability to use electrical weapons and artillery. On the other hand, you cant be everyone and everythingthough you can decide to forget abilities and redistribute those points if push comes to shove. Combat system Players can wield edged weapons, electric weapons, or firearms, so one of our main goals is to ensure parity between ranged players, tanks, and support players. One thing that is a significant help in that area is the ability to correctly select armor. Another is the combat ability system that opens when you level them up. Players who fight using edged weapons can demonstrate their skill by deciding where to aim their blows (stabbing from above, from the right, or from the left) and when to block their opponents parries. Battles between experienced swordsmen can be absolutely fascinating! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

Explore an Open World Mine resources (copper, iron, coal, gold, wood, and more), harvest the sap of the priceless celebrium trees, construct buildings, and protect your settlement from the dangers hidden on the Acribian islands. Defend Yourself from Pillage and Plunder Your biggest threat is the other settlers on the island. Taking what others have built is easier than building it yourself, so you must always be watchful. And, as they say, if you want peace, you must prepare for war. Protect yourself with customizable weapons, armor, guns, cannons and military airships. And if you need help, ally with people in nearby towns. Or Become the Conqueror Feeling aggressive and want to try raiding your neighbors? Youll need even bigger guns and sturdy armor. Construct Wondrous Architecture Construct shelter to protect you from the harsh Acribian conditions, build workshops in which you will create technological wonders, and engineer fortifications to defend yourself from attack. From these humble beginnings you will eventually build whole cities with steam smithies and your own airship fleet. Ride Fantastical Steampunk Vehicles Forget about exploring the island on foot. Steam Hammer puts a wide range of vehicles at your disposal. Take a ride on a classic steampunk motorbike or a steam-powered mechanical horse. When you are ready you can take to the sky, flying over obstacles with your jetpack or flying military airships to take longer voyages to raid neighbors and assault the temples of the Ancients. Advanced Combat System A powerful arsenal of weapons will be at your disposal. Choose between one-handed and two-handed melee weapons, single-shot and repeating firearms, lightning throwers, and negative charge generators. You can even wield magic! RPG Class System Steam Hammer features a flexible class system with no limitations. Be a sniper, techno-mage, stormtrooper, blacksmith, farmer, an alchemist, or an engineer. But you cant be all of them at once. Invite your friends to the world and build a team so you dont have to spend valuable time retraining. Master PvP Strategies Youll need to plan ahead and cooperate to defeat well-organized adversaries. This will be especially important when seizing forts and assaulting airships in PvP battles. You must lead your team effectively. Choose who will control the turrets and who will use their jetpack to board the enemys airships. As of now, all digital game copies will be delivered via Steam Key, so youll need a free Steam account to play. If the game is distributed across other channels in the future, backers will of course have the option to choose their preferred gaming platform. *A Stylized Victorian Portrait of You Will be Included in the Game *Your monument will be featured as one of the games objects. *Steam Hammer promo art piece painted by a professional artist *Dinner with the developers at a restaurant in Los Angeles *A special-order, life-size Steam Hammer replica We are an international team of developers from the US, Eastern Europe, and Russia. We share a love of steampunk and sandbox games. We all believe the steampunk setting deserves its own game where you can be as creative as you want. But game development is expensive and so we need your help to get the funds that will push Steam Hammer over the finish line. We want Steam Hammer to feature a huge new world, with trains, airships, steam-powered motorcycles, and all the classic features of the genre. We also want to fully develop the biopunk Acribians with their own crafting tree, weapons and biomechanical leviathans. But, to make this all happen, we need the support of the Kickstarter gaming community.
